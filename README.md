# 📊 Data Analytics Project — End-to-End Customer Behavior Analysis

## 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — from raw dataset ingestion to business insights and dashboard reporting. The project covers data loading in Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying in PostgreSQL, interactive dashboard creation in Power BI, and final reporting through a presentation deck.

The objective is to transform raw customer data into meaningful, decision-ready insights using industry-standard analytics tools.

Executed analytical SQL queries such as:
- Aggregations (COUNT, AVG, SUM)
- Grouped summaries
- Rating analysis
- Product purchase trends
- Customer behavior metrics

### Step 6 — Dashboard Creation
- Imported SQL data into Power BI
- Built interactive visuals
- Added filters and slicers
- Created KPI cards and trend charts
- Designed recruiter-friendly layout

### Step 7 — Reporting & Presentation
